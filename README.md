## Color Palette

There are six colors in the RMLUG Color Palette:


#### Spiro Disco Ball (_light blue_) - ![#30c5ff](https://placehold.it/15/30c5ff/000000?text=+) `#30c5ff` 

This primary color is used for the main logo and other large items against
light backgrounds, as well as text and small items against dark backgrounds.


#### Sunset Orange (_red/pink_) - ![#f05d5e](https://placehold.it/15/f05d5e/000000?text=+) `#f05d5e`

This is an alternate/highlight color for use on light backgrounds, and works
well as a visited link color.


#### Rajah (_yellow/gold_) - ![#ffc15e](https://placehold.it/15/ffc15e/000000?text=+) `#ffc15e` 

This is an alternate/highlight color for use on dark backgrounds. This color
works well in situations where Sunset Orange is too dark (e.g. visited links
on dark backgrounds)


#### Prussian Blue (_dark blue_) - ![#003459](https://placehold.it/15/003459/000000?text=+) `#003459` 

This is a heading color for large/bold text, as well as a primary color when 
artwork is too small to be used on a light background. It is also used for a
colored background of large sections of artwork (e.g. T-Shirts and posters).


#### Rich Black (_black_) - ![#00171f](https://placehold.it/15/00171f/000000?text=+) `#00171f` 

This is the main text color for light backgrounds, and the dark background
color for text content (where contrast is a concern)


#### White - `#ffffff`

This is the main background color for light-mode text content, and the
primary text color against dark backgrounds. When used for small, body text 
against dark backgrounds, decrease the opacity to 80% to help reduce 
constrast and eyestrain.


Additional color codes for these colors can be found in the `color_palette`
folder in this repository.


## Fonts

Use [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro) for body 
text and [Monoid](https://github.com/larsenwork/monoid) as monospace, heading, 
and quotation text.
